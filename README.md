# Commercial Demographic Analysis: Statistical Testing for Health and Lifestyle Metrics

STAT1378 Coding and Communication in Statistics Individual Project (2021)

This project analyzed demographic and health metrics (height, weight, physical activity, gender) using statistical hypothesis testing to derive commercial and lifestyle insights. Built as a full R project structure for reproducibility.

## Key Tasks
- Tested linear relationship between height and weight (regression)  
- Compared mean height between males and females (t-test, equal variances)  
- Examined association between gender and physical activity (chi-square test)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical hypothesis testing (regression, t-test, chi-square)  
- R project structure and reproducible workflows  
- Data organization, validation, and commercial insight generation  

## Submission Details
- Full R project folder structure preserved for reproducibility  
- **vignettes/articles/** folder contains original R Markdown source (STATProject.Rmd) + rendered HTML/PDF outputs, serving as package documentation and full report. This folder was used to store and organize all analysis code, explanations, and results in a reproducible format.  
- Unzip or explore folders (R/, data/, tests/, vignettes/, etc.) for complete project.

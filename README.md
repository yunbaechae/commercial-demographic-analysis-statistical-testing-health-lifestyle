# Commercial Demographic Analysis: Statistical Testing for Health and Lifestyle Metrics

STAT1378 Coding and Communication in Statistics Individual Project (2021)

This project analyzed demographic data (height, weight, physical activity, gender) using statistical hypothesis testing to derive commercial and lifestyle insights. Focused on linear relationships, group comparisons, and associations.

## Key Tasks
- Tested linear relationship between height and weight  
- Compared mean height between males and females (t-test, equal variances)  
- Examined association between gender and physical activity (chi-square)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Statistical hypothesis testing (linear regression, t-test, chi-square)  
- Data analysis for commercial and lifestyle insights  
- R programming for reproducible testing and reporting  

## Submission Details
- Original R project structure (R scripts in R/, data in data/, tests in tests/) included  
- RStudio project file (STATProject.Rproj) preserved for reproducibility
